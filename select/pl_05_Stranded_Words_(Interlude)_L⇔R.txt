Maybe these are stranded words
For I cannot complain
And the riot at the sunset
Paints the colour of the rain
I built my days on consequence
And now nothing's ringing true
But tonight, I need you
The air,
it feels like spring again
It always clears my thoughts
Like the saints
become the sinners
The haves become the nots
Have I shown you enough of me?
You know yourself
can be so hard to be
And tonight, I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
Ooo

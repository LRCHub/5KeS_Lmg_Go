Two souls beside the ocean
At the mercy of its tide
One warm and tender moment
One cold December night
There sat beneath the bright stars
How were we to understand
Our lives would change forever
That night upon Red strand

A stone's throw away from Galley Head
By and by it came to pass
A song carried us to our bed
Laid on the broken glass
The moon pulled the waters closer
Our defences were unmanned
And we let the waves roll over
That night upon Red Strand

And we rode the great white horses
Bareback towards the shore
We felt the ocean's forces
Like no one ever had before

And we heard the north wind speaking
For hidden in this magic land
We'd find what we were seeking
That night upon Red Strand

And we rode the great white horses
Bareback towards the shore
We felt the ocean's forces
Like no one ever had before

No more the one and only
Never more the one man band
How precious is the love we
Found on the golden sand
And I thank the lord above me
For that night upon Red Strand

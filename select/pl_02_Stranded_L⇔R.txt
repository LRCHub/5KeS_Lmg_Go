You are dealing underhanded,
so far
The closer that we get the more
I'm stranded
I'm tangled in this situation
Looks like you
got the best of me
I'm handing in my resignation
Sufferin' a cold defeat
for your love
I tell you secrets
and you're tellin' me lies
You paint a picture
and you cover my eyes
And since I found you
I've been lost in the night
And feeling stranded,
stranded - empty~handed
And I don't know
if I'll ever survive
First you want to please me
Then you want to tease me
Lead me to your lock
and throw away the only key
You are dealing underhanded,
so far
The closer that we get the more
I'm stranded
I'm takin'on a bad reaction
From putting on a one-man show
You'll never give me
satisfaction
I can't hold on and
can't let go of your love
I tell you secrets
and you're tellin' me lies
You paint a picture
and you cover my eyes
And since I found you
I've been lost in the night
And feeling stranded,
stranded - empty~handed
And I don't know
if I'll ever survive
First you want to please me
Then you want to tease me
Lead me to your lock
and throw away the only key
You are dealing underhanded,
so far
The closer that we get the more
I'm stranded
You are dealing underhanded,
so far
The closer that we get the
I'm stranded
You are dealing underhanded,
so far
The closer that we get the
I'm stranded
You are dealing underhanded,
so far
The closer that we get the
I'm stranded
You are dealing underhanded,
so far
The closer that we get the
I'm stranded
You are dealing underhanded,
so far

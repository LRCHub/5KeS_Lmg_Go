The more i try
The more i feel i'm missing
The more i run
The more my feet keep slipping
The more i think
The more i tend to worry
The more i look
I see my thoughts before me

And i dream of a strand
As i struggle on the waves
And i see the end of a passing day
As i see the strand
In the corners of my mind
Windows offer the view
Of a coming day

The more i stretch
The more these walls confine me
The more i beg
The less it all seems likely
The more i mind
The matter that surrounds me
The more i find
My thoughts before me

Drifting on an open sea
Shipwrecked clinging to broken beams
Waters to my neck
I strain to catch my breath
Drifting in the boundaries
I've built up deep within me
Waters to my neck
I strain to catch my breath
I'm tired of treading again
I'm swimming to the strand
